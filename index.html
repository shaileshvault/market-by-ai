            card3: `
                <h3>1. <strong>Trade Policies and Tariffs</strong></h3>
                <p><strong>Impact</strong>: Trump administration was known for its protectionist trade policies, including tariffs on imports from various countries. If similar policies were reinstated or continued, it could lead to increased tariffs on Indian goods, affecting exports.</p>
                <p><strong>Market Reaction</strong>: A potential decline in exports could negatively impact Indian companies reliant on the U.S. market, leading to a bearish sentiment in sectors like textiles and pharmaceuticals.</p>
                
                <h3>2. <strong>Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)</strong></h3>
                <p><strong>Impact</strong>: Trump focus on domestic manufacturing could deter U.S. companies from investing in India if they perceive a more favorable environment for investment back home. Conversely, if he promotes foreign investment in specific sectors (like defense or technology), it could benefit those industries in India.</p>
                <p><strong>Market Reaction</strong>: A reduction in FDI could lead to slower economic growth projections for India, negatively impacting stock prices, particularly in sectors that depend heavily on foreign capital.</p>

                <h3>3. <strong>Geopolitical Relations</strong></h3>
                <p><strong>Impact</strong>: Trump administration had a complex relationship with China, which could lead to shifts in alliances. If India is perceived as a counterbalance to China, U.S.-India relations might strengthen, benefiting Indian markets.</p>
                <p><strong>Market Reaction</strong>: Improved geopolitical ties could boost investor confidence in Indian equities, especially in defense and technology sectors.</p>

                <h3>4. <strong>Monetary Policy and Interest Rates</strong></h3>
                <p><strong>Impact</strong>: Changes in U.S. monetary policy under Trump leadership could influence global interest rates. For instance, if the Federal Reserve raises rates, it could lead to capital outflows from emerging markets like India as investors seek higher returns in the U.S.</p>
                <p><strong>Market Reaction</strong>: Rising interest rates can lead to increased borrowing costs in India, potentially slowing down economic growth and negatively impacting stock market performance.</p>

                <h3>5. <strong>Sector-Specific Impacts</strong></h3>
                <p><strong>Impact</strong>: Certain sectors may benefit from Trump policies, such as defense and infrastructure, due to increased military spending or infrastructure projects in the U.S. This could lead to increased demand for Indian companies involved in these sectors.</p>
                <p><strong>Market Reaction</strong>: Stocks in these sectors may see positive momentum as investors anticipate growth driven by U.S.-India collaborations or increased demand for products.</p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>The implications of Donald Trump policies on the Indian financial market are multifaceted and can vary widely across different sectors. Investors should remain vigilant about geopolitical developments and trade relations that may arise from U.S. policy shifts under any future administration resembling Trump’s approach. Monitoring these factors will be crucial for making informed investment decisions within the Indian market context.</p>

                <h3>Market Sentiment</h3>
                <p>ICICI Lombard has seen a positive market sentiment recently, with its stock price increasing by approximately 35.41% over the past year, outperforming both the NIFTY index and the Nifty Financial Services index, which rose by 8.15% and 11.28%, respectively. The stock has shown consistent gains, recently rising 2.21% in a single trading session, indicating strong investor confidence.</p>
                
                <h3>Financial Data</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Revenue</strong>: ₹61.6 billion for Q3 FY2025, up 19% from Q3 FY2024.</li>
                    <li><strong>Net Income</strong>: ₹7.24 billion, reflecting a significant increase of 68% year-on-year.</li>
                    <li><strong>Profit Margin</strong>: Improved to 12% from 8.3% in the previous year.</li>
                    <li><strong>Earnings Per Share (EPS)</strong>: Increased to ₹14.63 from ₹8.78.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The company is projected to grow its revenue at an average rate of <strong>12% per annum</strong> over the next three years, which is higher than the industry average of <strong>8.4%</strong>. However, it is essential to note that there is one warning sign regarding its investment analysis, which could indicate potential risks.</p>

                <h3>Growth Prospects</h3>
                <p>ICICI Lombard's growth prospects appear strong due to its robust financial performance and market position within the Indian insurance sector. The company's ability to exceed analyst expectations in both revenue and EPS suggests effective management and operational efficiency.</p>

                <h3>Investment Recommendation</h3>
                <p>Given the strong financial results and positive growth forecast, ICICI Lombard presents a compelling investment opportunity. Investors should consider buying at current levels around ₹1,950, with potential targets of ₹2,000 and ₹2,100 in the near future, contingent on market conditions and continued performance.</p>

            card5: `<h3>Market Sentiment</h3>
    <p>Zomato Ltd's stock has recently faced significant downward pressure, dropping over <strong>10%</strong> today to trade around ₹215.80 on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). This decline follows disappointing financial results for Q3 FY2025, where the company's net profit fell sharply by <strong>57.24%</strong> year-on-year to ₹59 crore, despite a substantial <strong>64.38%</strong> increase in revenue to ₹5,405 crore. The market sentiment is currently bearish, influenced by concerns over rising competition and the profitability of its quick commerce arm, Blinkit, which has seen heavy investment but is struggling with margins due to aggressive expansion and high operational costs.</p>

    <h3>Financial Data</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Q3 FY2025 Results</strong>:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Net Profit</strong>: ₹59 crore (down from ₹138 crore YoY)</li>
                <li><strong>Revenue</strong>: ₹5,405 crore (up from ₹3,288 crore YoY)</li>
                <li><strong>Total Expenses</strong>: ₹5,533 crore (up from ₹3,383 crore YoY)</li>
                <li><strong>Blinkit Revenue Growth</strong>: 117.23% YoY to ₹1,399 crore</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Zomato's total expenses surged primarily due to investments in Blinkit, which is facing fierce competition from other players in the quick commerce sector. Analysts have noted that while Blinkit is growing rapidly in terms of revenue, its profitability remains a concern as it incurs high costs for store expansions and customer acquisition.</p>

    <h3>Growth Prospects</h3>
    <p>Despite the current challenges, Zomato has potential growth avenues:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Quick Commerce Expansion</strong>: Blinkit’s rapid revenue growth indicates strong demand for quick delivery services. However, profitability may take time as the company continues to invest heavily in expanding its dark store network.</li>
        <li><strong>Market Positioning</strong>: Zomato remains a key player in both food delivery and quick commerce, with significant market share. Analysts project that as competition stabilizes, Zomato could benefit from economies of scale.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>However, analysts are divided on Zomato's future performance:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Macquarie projects a potential downside of <strong>44%</strong>, with a target price of ₹130 based on current market conditions and competitive pressures.</li>
        <li>Other brokerages like IIFL Securities have set target prices ranging from ₹250 to ₹300, citing expectations that competition may peak in 2025.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Investment Recommendation</h3>
    <p>Given the current financial performance and market sentiment:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Buy or Hold</strong>: Investors should be cautious about entering new positions in Zomato at this time due to the volatility and recent poor performance. A wait-and-see approach may be prudent until clearer signs of recovery and improved profitability emerge.</li>
        <li><strong>Target Levels</strong>: 
            <ul>
                <li>Short-term target levels could range between ₹200 and ₹250 based on current trading patterns.</li>
                <li>Long-term investors might consider waiting for a more favorable entry point if the stock stabilizes or shows signs of recovery post-Q4 results.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In conclusion, while Zomato has growth potential through its investments in Blinkit and its established market presence, current financial challenges and competitive pressures warrant caution for new investments at this time.</p>`

                </ol>
                
                <p>These stocks are strategically aligned with the government's focus areas for Budget 2025, which include infrastructure development, defense spending, and renewable energy investments.
